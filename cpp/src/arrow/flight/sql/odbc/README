Steps to Register the 64-bit Apache Arrow ODBC driver on Windows

After the build succeeds, the ODBC DLL will be located in 
`build\debug\Debug` for a debug build and `build\release\Release` for a release build.

1. Open Power Shell as administrator.

2. Register your ODBC DLL:
    Need to replace <path\to\repo> with actual path to repository in the commands.

    i. `cd to repo.`
    ii. `cd <path\to\repo>`
    iii. Run script to register your ODBC DLL as Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC Driver
    `.\cpp\src\arrow\flight\sql\odbc\install\install_amd64.cmd <path\to\repo>\cpp\build\< release | debug >\< Release | Debug>\arrow_flight_sql_odbc.dll`
    Example command for reference:
    `.\cpp\src\arrow\flight\sql\odbc\install\install_amd64.cmd C:\path\to\arrow\cpp\build\release\Release\arrow_flight_sql_odbc.dll`

If the registration is successful, then Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC Driver 
should show as an available ODBC driver in the x64 ODBC Driver Manager.
